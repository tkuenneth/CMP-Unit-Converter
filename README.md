# Welcome to CMP Unit Converter

This repo contains a real-world example of a *Compose Multiplatform* app. *CMP Unit Converter* runs on Android, iOS, and the Desktop. As its name suggests, you can convert between various units. While this may provide some value, the main goal is to show how to use Compose Multiplatform and a couple of other multiplatform libraries, for example:

- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
- [Compose Material 3 Adaptive](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3-adaptive)
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/datastore)
